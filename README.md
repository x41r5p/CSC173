程序  Trace   the   execution   of   the   machine   M2    from   Sipser   Example   3.7   on   each   of   the following   inputs:<br>(a)      0<br>(b)      00<br>(c)      000<br>(d)    000000<br>4.   Trace   the   execution   of   the   machine   M1    from   Sipser   Example   3.9   on   each   of   the following   inputs:<br>(a)      11<br>(b)      11<br>(c)      11<br>(d)      1011<br>(e)      1010<br>5.    Design   and   write   the   formal   definition   of   a   Turing    machine   with   input   alphabet   {a,   b}   that   scans   to   the   right   until   it   finds   two   consecutive   a’s   and   then   accepts.<br>(a)    Does   your   machine   halt   on   all   inputs?<br>(b)    If   not, could   you   design   one   that   does   halt   on   all   inputs?<br>(c)      Can   this   language,   the   set   of   strings   that   contain   two   consecutive   a’s,   be decided   by   a   simpler   type   of   machine   (that   we   have   seen   in   this   class)?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>加QQ：99515681  WX：codinghelp  Email: 99515681@qq.com
